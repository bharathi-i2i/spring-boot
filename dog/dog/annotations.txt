Annotations:

@SpringBootApplication - it works all @Configuration @ComponentScan @EnableAutoConfiguration.

@Configuration - If we give this annotation in top of any class, then the class will provide one or more @Bean methods, 
                 also the spring container generate the bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime. 

@ComponentScan - with no args - then it tells to spring container to scan the @Component class file in current package
                                and its all sub packages.
                 with path args - then it tells to spring container to scan the @Component class file in specified argumented package.

@EnableAutoConfiguration - it tells to spring container to auto configure the jar dependencies mentioned in pom file.
                           For example, if you add spring-boot-starter-web dependency in your classpath, it automatically configures Tomcat and Spring MVC.

@RestController - it is the combination of @Controller and @Responsebody. It returns the response with object of json or xml format.

@Controller - is to create a Map of the model object and find a view. It handle requests coming from client then redirects the client to a logical view name.

@ResponseBody - it tells a controller that the object returned is automatically serialized into JSON and passed back into the HttpResponse object.
